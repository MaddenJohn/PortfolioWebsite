# PortfolioWebsite

The infrastructure is simple. Its a static website hosted on AWS S3 and optimized using Route 53 and CloudFront. The front end was initially generated using the jekyll static website generated and then modified. I also used s3_website, an OS project, for an easier deploy of my resources in AWS.
