# PortfolioWebsite

The infrastructure is simple. Its a static website hosted on AWS S3 and optimized using Route 53 and CloudFront. The front end was initially generated using the jekyll static website generated and then modified. I also used s3_website, an OS project, for an easier deploy of my resources in AWS. 


Check out /website/files/README.md for information on how to use s3_website like I did. 

The configuration files I customized and used are in /free-theme/ and the actual website files that have been deployed to S3 can be found in /free-theme/_site/*
